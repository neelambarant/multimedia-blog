      Salaar: Part 1 – Ceasefire is a 2023 Indian action drama directed by
      Prashanth Neel, following the story of Deva (Prabhas), a reclusive but
      unstoppable warrior who returns from hiding to protect his childhood
      friend Varadha (Prithviraj Sukumaran) as the violent kingdom of Khansaar
      faces a deadly power struggle. The film explores themes of loyalty,
      brotherhood, and betrayal while showcasing massive action sequences,
      intense political intrigue, and the rise of Deva as a feared force in the
      chaotic empire. With its gritty visuals, heavy world-building, and
      emotionally driven bond between the leads, the movie builds toward a
      shocking revelation about Deva’s true identity and ends on a suspenseful
      cliffhanger that directly sets the stage for Salaar Part 2: Shouryaanga
      Parvam.

      KGF: Chapter 2 is a 2022 Indian action blockbuster directed by Prashanth
      Neel that continues the rise of Rocky, who, after taking control of the
      Kolar Gold Fields, becomes a feared ruler and a symbol of hope for the
      oppressed while facing powerful enemies from all sides. The film expands
      the world and stakes of the first part, showing Rocky’s ruthless ambition,
      strategic mind, and brutal dominance as he battles the Indian government,
      hostile gold cartels, and the terrifying Adheera, who seeks to reclaim
      KGF. The story follows Rocky’s journey as he builds an empire through
      violence, loyalty, and charisma, while also struggling with his promise to
      his dying mother to rise from poverty and achieve greatness. With massive
      action sequences, dramatic confrontations, emotional moments, and
      high-voltage performances, the movie showcases Rocky’s evolution from a
      feared assassin to an unstoppable legend. As political and criminal forces
      close in on him, the film leads to an explosive climax that questions
      whether Rocky’s destiny lies in power, sacrifice, or destruction, setting
      the stage for future possibilities in the KGF universe.

      Pushpa 2: The Rule is an upcoming Indian action drama directed by Sukumar, continuing the intense journey of Pushpa Raj (Allu Arjun) as he rises even 
      higher in the red-sanders smuggling syndicate after surviving an attack and escaping police custody. The film explores Pushpa’s transformation from a 
      feared smuggler to a rebellion symbol, as his growing power threatens political leaders, rival gangs, and the police force led by the relentless DSP 
      Bhanwar Singh Shekhawat (Fahadh Faasil), who seeks revenge after being humiliated by Pushpa in the first installment. With bigger stakes, larger-scale 
      conflict, and deeper emotional and political layers, the movie focuses on Pushpa’s dominance, his relationship with Srivalli, and the war that erupts 
      as enemies unite to bring him down. Known for its intense action, rugged style, and mass appeal, Pushpa 2: The Rule aims to elevate the franchise to a 
      national level with grand visuals, powerful confrontations, and Pushpa’s iconic attitude returning stronger than ever.
